To run the downloaded React project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your command line (e.g., Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the directory where you've downloaded the React project. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

    Example:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/react-project
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: In most cases, you'll need to install the project's dependencies using npm. Run the following command to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command reads the `package.json` file in your project directory and installs all the dependencies listed there.

4. **Install Axios**

    ```bash
    npm install axios
    ```

5. **Start the Development Server**: React projects often come with development servers that allow you to preview your application locally. You can start the development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the development server and open your React app in a web browser. By default, it usually runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Stopping the Development Server**: To stop the development server, go back to your command line and press `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on macOS). This will stop the server, and you can close the terminal window.
